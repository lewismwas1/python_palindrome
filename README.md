                          Part 1
This Python code defines a function called highest_palindrome that takes two numbers (num1 and num2) as input.
The purpose of the function is to find the highest palindrome that can be obtained by concatenating the two input numbers.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

num_str1 = str(num1): Convert the first input number (num1) to a string and store it in the variable num_str1.

num_str2 = str(num2): Convert the second input number (num2) to a string and store it in the variable num_str2.

concate_str = num_str1 + num_str2: Concatenate the two string representations of the input numbers and store the result in the variable concate_str.

concate_rev = concate_str[::-1]: Reverse the concatenated string (concate_str) and store the result in the variable concate_rev.

highest_palindrome = int(concate_str + concate_rev): Concatenate the original concatenated string and its reverse, convert the result back to an integer, and store it in the variable highest_palindrome.

The print("Highest palindrome is : ") statement is currently outside the function and won't execute as intended. To print the result, you should move this statement inside the function and print the highest_palindrome variable.


                    Part 2
                    
1. def largest_palindrome():: This line defines a function named largest_palindrome with no parameters.

2. max_palindrome = 0: Initializes a variable max_palindrome to 0. This variable will be used to store the largest palindrome found during the iterations.

3. for x in range(10, 100):: The outer loop iterates over values of x from 10 to 99 (excluding 100).

4. for y in range(x, 100):: The inner loop iterates over values of y from x to 99. This avoids redundant calculations, as multiplication is commutative (e.g., 10 * 20 is the same as 20 * 10).

5. product = x * y: Calculates the product of x and y and stores it in the variable product.

6. if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and product > max_palindrome:: Checks if the product is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) and if it is greater than the current max_palindrome.

7. If the conditions in the previous step are met, it updates max_palindrome with the value of the current product.

8. The loops continue to iterate, and the process repeats for different values of x and y.

9. After the loops finish, the function returns the max_palindrome found during the iterations.

10. large = largest_palindrome(): Calls the largest_palindrome function and stores the result (the largest palindrome) in the variable large.

11. print("Largest palindrome is:", large): Prints the message "Largest palindrome is:" followed by the value stored in the large variable, which represents the largest palindrome found by the function.

                                   Part 3
    
1. def div(x):: This line defines a function named div that takes a parameter x. The purpose of this function is to check if x is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 19.
2. divisible = True: Initializes a variable divisible to True. This variable will be used to track whether x is divisible by all numbers in the specified range.
3. for i in range(1, 20):: The loop iterates over values of i from 1 to 19 (excluding 20).
4. if x % i != 0:: Checks if x is not divisible by i. If this condition is true, it sets divisible to False and breaks out of the loop.
5. break: Exits the loop if the condition in the previous step is met.
6. return divisible: Returns the final value of divisible after the loop completes. If the loop completes without encountering a case where x is not divisible by i, then divisible remains True.
7. numb = div: Assigns the function div to the variable numb. Now, numb is a reference to the div function.
8. result = numb(20): Calls the function referenced by numb with the argument 20 and stores the result in the variable result.
9. print(result): Prints the result obtained from calling the div function with the argument 20. The result will be True if 20 is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 19, and False otherwise.
